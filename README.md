# console-app-with-GPT3-API-Client

This is a small console application that utilizes the GPT-3 API client to interact with the OpenAI GPT-3 language model. The application allows users to pass a prompt to the GPT-3 model through the command line, and receive a generated response from the model in return. The application makes use of the HttpClient class to send a POST request to the OpenAI API, which includes the prompt as well as other parameters such as the model and temperature. The response from the API is then parsed and the generated text is printed to the console. The application also has basic error handling in place, to handle any errors that may occur while making the API call or parsing the response.
This application can be used as a simple example of how to interact with the OpenAI GPT-3 API, and could be built upon to add additional functionality and improve user experience.


And this project is also using Async method to perform the call to the OpenAI API in a non-blocking way, making it more efficient.
